Method:
A method is  a block of code that, when called, does defined actions.

Call Stack:
It is for managing method execution and variable scope. LIFO.

Java is pass-by-value. The code here is just a demonstration on how pass-by-reference works.

Variable Scope:
- Loop scope
Variables declared within a loop can only be accessed within the loop.
This is referred to as loop scope.
- Class Scope (Instances Variables)
Instance variables are declared within a class but not in any methods.
All methods within the class can access them, and if the variable is public, other classes can use them as well.
This is referred tp as class scope.

Return value:
The return value of a method is the result that the method generates and returns to the caller.
-Void Method
Used to perform an action without returning any value.
-Non-Void Method
Returns a value.

Method Overloading:
Using the same method name that takes different parameters.

Recursive method:
Methods that call themselves to solve an issue.
Best practices:
- Base Case
- Recursive case: each recursive call reduces the problem size to get closer to the base case
- Efficiency
Stack overflow:
When the recursive method has no way to reach the end
